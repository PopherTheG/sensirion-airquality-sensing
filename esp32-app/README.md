ESP32 Application for reading sensor data using Sensirion sensors.
====================
In idf.py menuconfig there is a component configuration for 'AIR QUALITY SENSORS CONFIGURATION'  
this is where you would check/uncheck the sensors you have installed. This is important since,  
it would only compile the codes for sensors that are existing in your set-up.
